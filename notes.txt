If You Have Limited Resources: MiniAlexNet or a VGG variant can give you decent results without the computational burden.
For Real-time Applications: YOLO is ideal due to its speed, making it suitable for streaming data from parking lot cameras.
For High Precision: Mask R-CNN is the best choice when accuracy and detail are critical, such as in environments with overlapping cars or a need for instance-level segmentation.
